\# Cookie Clicker Reflection



\## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

What helped me understand DOM interaction best was assigning elements to variables as a way to reach the elements.

\## How did you choose your milestone messages?

My milestone messages entailed encouraging the user to keep clicking until the last milestone was achieved.

&nbsp;

\## What challenge or bug surprised you?

The challenge that surprised me was writing the html code for clicking. I used "cursor: pointer; to click the cookie button.



\## What personal twist did you add?

I customized the cookie clicker app by changing the background color for each milestone.



\## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

The Amazon app uses a similar interaction. A message will appear informing a user when an item has been added to the cart and the "counter" updates the number of items.
